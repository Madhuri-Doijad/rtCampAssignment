### Challenge-2: WordPress Plugin Challenge

There are already more than 10000 WordPress plugins out there. So itâ€™s really hard to setup a challenge for you! Still, we need to create a playground for you. So we came up with a few ideas for plugin. Go ahead with any one below:

#### Challenge-2a: WordPress-Slideshow Plugin

This plugin will test if you are familiar with WordPress shortcodes. 

**Admin-Side:**

1.  Create an admin-side settings page.
2.  Provide an interface to add/remove images from plugin settings page.
3.  User must be able to change order of uploaded image. (Hint: Use [http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#connect-lists](http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#connect-lists) )

**Front-end:**

1.  Create provision for a shortcode like \[myslideshow\]
2.  When you add shortcode \[myslideshow\] to any page, it will be replaced by a slideshow of images uploaded from admin-side.
3.  You can use any jQuery slideshow library/plugin.

#### Challenge-2b: WordPress-Contributors Plugin

This plugin will test if you are familiar with [WordPress metabox](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_meta_box) functionality. Goal is to create a plugin so that we can display more than one author-name on a post. 

**Admin-Side:**

1.  Add a new metabox, labeled "contributors" to WordPress post-editor page.
2.  This metabox will display list of authors (wordpress users) with a checkbox for each author.
3.  User (author/editor/admin) may tick one or more authors name from the list.
4.  When post saves, states of checkboxes for author-list in "contributors" box must be saved as well.

**Front-end:**

1.  Use a post-content filter.
2.  At the end of post, display a box called "Contributors".
3.  It will have list of authors checked for that post.
4.  Show contributor names with their Gravatars.
5.  Contributor-names must be clickable and will link to their respective "author" page.
